    <p>I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and even the big Kahuna, Christmas himself. It never fails to impress a crowd and make the lactose intolerant second guess what they're missing.</p>
    
    <p>Though this Mom On Timeout recipe is kick-ass as is, there's a couple additions I have made that really take it to the next level. This includes smoked gouda and some extra spices. You do not want to miss out on the subtle smokey element that compliments the sweet and savory cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz cavatappi macaroni, cooked</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>4 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1 cups Gruyere cheese shredded</li>
        <li>1 cups smoked Gouda cheese shredded</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, garlic, onion, paprika to taste</li>

        <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese shredded</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika (or regular paprika)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Cook the pasta one minute shy of al dente according to the package instructions. Remove from heat, drain, and place in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle pasta with olive oil and stir to coat pasta. Set aside to cool while preparing cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a deep saucepan, dutch oven, or stock pot.</li>
        <li>Whisk in flour over medium heat and continue whisking for about 1 minute until bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the milk and heavy cream until nice and smooth. Continue whisking until you see bubbles on the surface and then continue cooking and whisking for another 2 minutes. Whisk in spices.</li>
        <li>Add two cups of shredded cheese and whisk until smooth. Add another two cups of shredded cheese and continue whisking until creamy and smooth. Sauce should be nice and thick.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cooled pasta until combined and pasta is fully coated with the cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour half of the mac and cheese into the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining 2 cups of shredded cheese and then the remaining mac and cheese.</li>
