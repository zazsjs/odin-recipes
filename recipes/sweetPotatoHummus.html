    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large sweet potato (about 1.5 lbs), peeled and cut into large pieces</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, roasted</li>
        <li>3 TBSP tahini</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 TBSP lemon or lime juice</li>
        <li>pepper, onion, paprika, etc. to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 375°. Scatter sweet potato on a lined baking sheet, generously drizzle with oil, and toss to coat. Peel the outer, papery layers of the bulb (you should be able to see some individual cloves in their papery skin) then cut just about ½ inch from the top of the cloves, cutting away the papery ends, so the cloves are exposed. Place on a sheet of tin foil and drizzle with olive oil until top is covered. Pull the corners of the tin foil up so they meet above the cut top of the garlic. Gently grip the tin foil to creat a loose seal. Roast the sweet potatoes and garlic, tossing the sweet potatoes halfway through, until the sweet potato is tender and browned in a few spots and garlic is golden brown and soft when poked with a knife, about 40-45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let vegetables cool slightly, then transfer to a food processor or blender and purée until smooth. Add tahini, lemon juice, and spices; pulse to incorporate. With motor running, gradually add 1 cup water. Mixture should be the consistency of hummus; add a little more water if needed. Taste and season with more spices if needed.</li>
    </ol>
